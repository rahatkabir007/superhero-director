Project Name - Filmify - A small movie buying website.
Details of the project-

1) Creating The JSON File:
- I have created a fake db file with 6-7 detailed information to use as API! 
- My own JSON file has 14 objects in an array! 
- I have used different key value for each object to avoid runtime error! 
- Every object has its own detailed info about that particular movie/object!

2) Creating UI
- I have created the UI dividing into two section. 1) Heading & 2) Main body
- Heading part is divided by two components with their individual JS and CSS files.
- Main Body Is divided into three part. The parent component and its two child component.
- I have used font awesome CDN to view some icon. 
- I also used Bootstrap CDN for the most part of the website! But beside that i also did some pure CSS to customize some part of the UI.
- On the heading part i added a search input so that user can find what they are looking for.
- Also added button to each card to interact with the website.

3) Functionality
- I added an event handler to the button of the card. So that user can see that particular data.
- With the button the user can see how much each movie costs and what is their total!
- The detailed information has another button which will redirect the user to see the trailer of that particular movie.
- added a slight functionality to search the movie by name of that movie!
